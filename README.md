## Introduction

The problem at hand involves constructing and comparing the performance of three distinct feed-forward/back propagating neural networks using a dataset of online news articles. The ultimate goal is to develop models capable of predicting a categorical indicator variable derived from the dataset's "share" attribute, indicating the level of shares an online news article receives.

To address this problem, I plan to follow a structured approach:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 

3. **Data Preparation**: 
4. **Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction**:
5. **Neural Network Modeling**: 
6. **Model Evaluation and Selection**:

7. ## Sample from the jupyter notebook
